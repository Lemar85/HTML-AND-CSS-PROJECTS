# HTML-AND-CSS-PROJECTS
 Here is where you will find all of my projects using HTML and CSS

 ## Large Projects:
 - The Pet Shop Website 
 - Simple-Recipes Website
 - The Academy-Cinemas Website
 - The Grace Hopper Tribute Website
    - inside the HTMLCSS folder

These are somme of the larger projects that were created during this course. The websites were created using HTML and styled using CSS. In each website you will find elemnts like the navbar that is fixed in place and styled with hover effects, images that are also styled with hover effects and sizes adjusted when visting the site from a desktop or devices with smaller screens and also find that the navbar links will take you to their respective sections of each page.

## Small Projects
- Creating-CSS-Effects
- HTML AND CSS Challenges
- Introduction-to-Bootstrap
- Media Query Challenge

These are some of the other projects that were also created using HTML and CSS and also using bootstrap. I created these as warmup and practice exercises to build up my skills to ultimately create the larger projects listed above.
